Agenda: Kubernetes Dash Board Setup
=======

Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use Dashboard to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot your containerized application, and manage the cluster resources. 

You can use Dashboard to get an overview of applications running on your cluster, as well as for creating or modifying individual Kubernetes resources (such as Deployments, Jobs, DaemonSets, etc). 

For example, you can scale a Deployment, initiate a rolling update, restart a pod or deploy new applications using a deploy wizard.

Dashboard also provides information on the state of Kubernetes resources in your cluster and on any errors that may have occurred.


Login to Kubernetes master machine And Follow Bellow Setps.

1. Certificates
====================

You need a dashboard.key and dashboard.crt files for HTTPS.
It is easy to create self signed ones.

mkdir $HOME/certs

cd $HOME/certs

openssl genrsa -out dashboard.key 2048
openssl rsa -in dashboard.key -out dashboard.key
openssl req -sha256 -new -key dashboard.key -out dashboard.csr
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in dashboard.csr -signkey dashboard.key -out dashboard.crt

Load the certificates into a secret:
====================================

kubectl create namespace kubernetes-dashboard

kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard create secret generic kubernetes-dashboard-certs --from-file=$HOME/certs

2. Deploy dashboard
====================

Use the recommended setup to deploy the kubernetes-dashboard service account, role, rolebinding, deployment and service.

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.4.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml



3. Check if the replica set is fulfuilled. Find the dashboard replica set

kubectl get rs  -n kubernetes-dashboard


  
4. Expose dashboard service on a NodePort.

Finally, we can expose the dashboard service on a NodePort. This will allow it to be publically accessible via a port forwarded on the Kubernetes hosts.

Edit the kubernetes-dashboard service and change the following options.
spec.type from ClusterIP to NodePort

kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard edit service kubernetes-dashboard 



5. Create A Service Account & ClusterRole 



# Service Account & Cluster Role Binding

apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: k8s-admin
  namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: k8s-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: k8s-admin
  namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
  

Get Bearer token
===================  
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard describe secret $(kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get secret | grep k8s-admin | awk '{print $1}')
